NOTE_1: This mainly includes citations for sources that I used for my project. 

NOTE_2: The code that I used from other people came from Youtube videos only. The code I found was used as a foundation for my game because I had
	to manipulate and add more code myself in order for my game to function. 

NOTE_3: The artwork that I had created for this game is included in the "MyArt" folder at the highest level of the game folder directory.
	I created the artwork using photshop. 

NOTE_4: Game can be played on simmer.io using this link: https://simmer.io/@jamesfoti/foxjumper

NOTE_5: There is a minor bug with the character jumping that causes a sharp increase in the jump velocity. This happens once in a while.
